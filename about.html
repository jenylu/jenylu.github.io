                <p class="about-title"><b>Hello there! I'm Jennifer.</b></p>
                <p> I'm currently a third year undergraduate
                    studying computer science at UC San Diego. I am from the Bay Area, 
                    born in Palo Alto and raised in Cupertino. I decided to pursue
                    computer science after taking an intro class during winter quarter
                    of my freshman year because I loved being able to make things. Computer
                    science challenges me to problem solve and think differently.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Experience </strong> </p>
                <p> Last summer, I was an intern at Microsoft as part of the Bing Core UX team.
                    I created an internal testing tool that would allow developers/testers to
                    compare how a feature they created would look across different browsers and 
                    devices. I am also part of the outreach committee for Women In Computing 
                    where I am planning 'Girl's Day Out', an event to encourage local high 
                    school girls to join the STEM field. Currently, I am a tutor for the CSE Department
                    for CSE 11, Introduction to Computer Science and Object-Oriented Programming: Java. </p>
                <p><strong>Personal Interests </strong></p>
                <p> In my free time, I like sketching and painting. I also enjoy swimming, playing
                    piano, and nail art. I am always up for trying new things!</p>
